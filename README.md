# Local RAG App — **User Guide**

Ask questions over **your own files** and see two answers side-by-side:
- **RAG** (grounded in your uploaded docs)
- **Bare LLM** (the model’s best guess without your docs)

_No coding needed._

## 🧭 Use the App (3 steps)

1. **Upload**  
   Click **Upload** and choose any mix of **.pdf / .txt / .md / .csv**.  
   *Tip:* CSVs are indexed **row-by-row**, so you can ask row-level questions.

2. **Build Index**  
   Click **Build** (defaults are fine). This prepares your files for search.

3. **Ask**  
   Type your question and press **Ask**.  
   - Left: **RAG** answer citing retrieved chunks  
   - Right: **Bare LLM** answer (no documents used)  
   Expand **Retrieved Chunks** to see which files/rows were used.

## 📝 Tips

- Your data stays **local** on your machine.
- If answers feel off, increase **Top-K** (e.g., 8–10) or rephrase the question.
- Scanned PDFs need OCR first (export a text-based PDF or paste into `.txt`).

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **“No index yet”** → You uploaded files but didn’t click **Build**.  
- **Model/embedding error** → Make sure Ollama is running and you pulled the two models above.  
- **Upload fails** → Only `.pdf/.txt/.md/.csv` are accepted. Try a small `.txt` to test.

## 🔒 Privacy

Everything runs locally. Your files are stored in `data/`; the search index is in `artifacts/`.  
Use the **Clear** button to delete uploads at any time.
